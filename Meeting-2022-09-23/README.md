# Minutes

## Improvements from Uwe regarding AI4EU Experiments

- After on-boarding effort
  - Selecting model type could be moved to on-boarding
- Model types do not fit planning and reasoning
  - Can we provide planning-related types from AIPlan4EU? More generally, it may be something I could bring up in the technical integration working group where we already discuss common tags for the CMS.
- Visualization of connections in design studio
  - Compatibility and symbols are based on internal types not message
    name. This makes it difficult to correctly connect edges in some
    cases. Having a toggle to switch between the current way and a more
    strict way (requiring message name matches) would be useful.

## Explanation from Bruno regarding the ICT-38 metadata tempates

In attachment i’ve added the templates that we’ve being used to gather and populate information in our catalogue.

The templates, focus on both the tools (we call them components) and Use cases, with focus where the tools are being used and for what, and results such as in the form of KPIs.

We’ve being using this templates as the base of our tool https://www.Iot-Catalogue.com/.

As i mentioned in the telco, we are using our iot-catalogue as the “database” for the several marketplaces that we have being developing in the projects, we are using two plugins, one for wordpress and other for liferay:
- https://github.com/unparallel-innovation/IoT-Catalogue-Plugin-Wordpress
- https://github.com/unparallel-innovation/IoT-Catalogue-Plugin-Liferay

You can for instance see the example of the plugins on http://www.edge4industry.eu/ and http://www.pdm4industry.eu/.
