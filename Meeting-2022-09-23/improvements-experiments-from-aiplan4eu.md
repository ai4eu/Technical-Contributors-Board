- After on-boarding effort
  - Selecting model type could be moved to on-boarding
- Model types do not fit planning and reasoning

- Visualization of connections in design studio
  - Compatibility and symbols are based on internal types not message
    name. This makes it difficult to correctly connect edges in some
    cases. Having a toggle to switch between the current way and a more
    strict way (requiring message name matches) would be useful.
