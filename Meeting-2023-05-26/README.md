## Update on the AIoD Meta Data API
Jos van der Velde:

This is the python code of the platform.
There it's described how to setup database and api on your own computer (using docker)
Â I'm busy right now to refactor it a bit, to make it easier to add resources. 
Please let me know if anything is unclear (we will add hello-world and better documentation)
