The integration concept of AIPlan4EU are very welcome and raised no technical concerns.

The topic of voting was discussed controversially and no final decision was taken. Meanwhile, the TGB will continue on the technical level but without voting. 

Here is a list of the main arguments:

* We need a mechanism to scale: there will be at least 44 additional EU-funded projects related to the AI On Demand Platform
* The "old" AI4EU voting members are obsolete
* The rules of the TGB need to be clearly defined and approved by the EC
* A voting mandate could be time limited
* Not all projects are actively developing at the same time
* There should be a purely technical board to support the open distributed development process
* The TGB continues, but voting is suspended until the rules are clarified
